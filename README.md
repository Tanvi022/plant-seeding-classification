Plant Seedling Classification Using Streamlit
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify plant seedlings and deploy it using Streamlit. The model takes images of plant seedlings as input and predicts the class of the plant. It is a great way to learn how to integrate machine learning with a user-friendly web interface.

Project Overview
In this project, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of plant seedlings. The model is trained on a dataset of plant seedlings, and we use Streamlit to create an interactive web app for users to upload images of seedlings and receive predictions.

Features
Image Classification: Users can upload images of seedlings, and the app predicts which plant species it is.
Interactive UI: The app provides a simple user interface where users can upload images and view the results.
Model Performance: The model provides confidence scores for predictions, giving users insights into how confident the model is in its classification.

How to Run the App


Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-seedling-classification.git
cd plant-seedling-classification


Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the app.
Usage
Once the app is running, follow these steps:

Upload an image of a plant seedling by clicking the "Browse files" button.
After uploading, the model will process the image and predict which plant species it belongs to.
The prediction, along with a confidence score, will be displayed below the uploaded image.
Example Output:
Prediction: "Plant Species: Wheat"
Confidence: "Confidence: 92.3%"
Model Details
Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers designed to extract features from the images.
Training Data: The model is trained on a dataset of plant seedlings, which includes multiple plant species.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and validation metrics.
Model Training (Optional)
If you'd like to train your own model, you can follow these steps:

Prepare the Dataset: Collect a labeled dataset of plant seedling images. The dataset should contain images categorized by species.
Preprocess the Images: Resize the images to a uniform size and normalize pixel values.
Build the Model: Define and compile a CNN model in Keras/TensorFlow.
Train the Model: Use the training dataset to train the model and validate it using a separate validation set.
Save the Model: Save the trained model as a .h5 file (or another format based on your framework).
Integrate the Model: Place the saved model in the model/ directory and load it in the app.py script.
Customization
You can customize the app by:

Updating the model: Replace the plant_model.h5 file with a new model.
Improving UI: Streamlit allows customization of the layout and style. Modify app.py to change the appearance of the app.
Additional Features: Implement features like multiple image uploads, display of top-k predictions, or other plant-related information.
Troubleshooting
Error: "ModuleNotFoundError": Ensure all dependencies are installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Error: "TensorFlow not found": Make sure you have TensorFlow installed with pip install tensorflow.
Model not loading: Verify that the model file is in the correct directory and named appropriately (plant_model.h5).
